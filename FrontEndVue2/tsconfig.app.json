    This prevents "Cannot write file '<...>.js' because it would overwrite

    Vite already compiles to js, so we don't need extra js being emitted by ts
    files. Although this emitting of js seems to be prevented by vite, ts
    intellisense seems to think js is still going to output and overwrite
    its own self (because it is included in **\/* and has the same file
    extension). You cant exclude js, or only include ts because then js
    intellisense doesn't work.
